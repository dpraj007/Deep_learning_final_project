Okay, I've analyzed the provided logs for the Bokeh library and identified the following deprecations:

1. Deprecation: `Deprecate Oval`
   Example:
    Usecase : Usage of the Oval glyph will be deprecated in favor of other elliptic glyphs or custom solutions.
   ```python
   from bokeh.plotting import figure, show
   
   # Example of deprecated Oval glyph usage
   p = figure()
   p.oval(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[1, 2, 3], width=1, height=2, angle=0.5)
   show(p)
   ```

2. Deprecation: `cElementTree has been deprecated and will be removed in favor of ElementTree`
   Example:
    Usecase : The cElementTree library was used internally, and the import will be changed to use ElementTree. 
   ```python
   # This is an implicit deprecation because it refers to an internal change.
   # Users likely wouldn't import cElementTree directly from Bokeh.
   import xml.etree.cElementTree as ET # This import will be replaced with xml.etree.ElementTree
   ```

3. Deprecation: `Deprecate css rendering modes for annotations`
    Example:
    Usecase : Rendering mode of annotations using CSS is going to be deprecated
   ```python
   from bokeh.plotting import figure, show
   from bokeh.models import Label

   # Example of deprecated css_classes
   p = figure()
   label = Label(x=10, y=10, text="Some text", render_mode='css', css_classes=['my_label'])
   p.add_layout(label)
   show(p)
   ```
4. Deprecation: `Deprecate widgetbox`
   Example:
   Usecase : The widgetbox layout element will be deprecated in favor of using a more generic row/column layout.
   ```python
   from bokeh.layouts import widgetbox
   from bokeh.models.widgets import Button
   
   #Example of deprecated widgetbox
   button1 = Button(label="Button 1")
   button2 = Button(label="Button 2")
   
   layout = widgetbox(button1, button2)
   ```
5. Deprecation: `Deprecate bokehjs package and suggest @bokeh/bokehjs`
   Example:
    Usecase :  Old way of importing the BokehJS library will be replaced with the @bokeh/bokehjs.
   ```html
    <!-- Old way of importing bokehjs -->
   <script src="./bokehjs/bokeh.min.js"></script>
   
    <!-- New way of importing bokehjs -->
   <script src="./node_modules/@bokeh/bokehjs/dist/bokeh.min.js"></script>
   ```
6. Deprecation: `Remove old ad-hoc callback properties`
    Example:
    Usecase : Older method of connecting callbacks properties will be deprecated in favor of using js_on_change or js_link
   ```python
   from bokeh.plotting import figure, show
   from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, Slider
   from bokeh.layouts import column
   
   # Example of deprecated ad-hoc callback properties
   source = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6]))
   p = figure()
   line = p.line(x='x', y='y', source=source)
   
   slider = Slider(start=0, end=10, value=1, step=1)
   
   def callback(attr, old, new):
      source.data['x'] = [i * new for i in [1,2,3]]
      source.change.emit() # Deprecated way of emitting change
   
   slider.on_change('value', callback)
   
   layout = column(slider, p)
   show(layout)
   ```
Okay, I've analyzed the provided logs for the Bokeh- Visualization library and identified the following deprecations.

Here's the report:

1. Deprecation: `Selenium deprecation warning because of log_path`
   Example:
   Usecase :  **This indicates that the `log_path` argument in Selenium usage with Bokeh is deprecated. While we can not provide a use case as there is no use of bokeh's code , the error indicates that using `log_path` directly is deprecated and selenium users need to upgrade to latest version**
   ```
      # No code snippet available, this is a deprecation on how selenium is used
   ```

2. Deprecation: `numpy.bool8 is deprecated`
   Example:
   Usecase : **This indicates that usage of `numpy.bool8` type is deprecated and should be replaced with another similar type. However, this is related to the numpy library and no bokeh code is used, so no code is available to show an example**
   ```
    # No code snippet available, this is a deprecation in numpy, not bokeh
   ```

3.  Deprecation: `select_every_mousemove` to `continuous`
    Example:
    Usecase: **The log states that `select_every_mousemove` has been renamed to `continuous`, which suggests that `select_every_mousemove` is deprecated.**
    ```python
    #Deprected
    hover = HoverTool(tooltips=[("x", "$x"), ("y", "$y")], select_every_mousemove=True)
    ```

4.  Deprecation: `CanvasRenderingContext2D` polyfills
    Example:
    Usecase: **The removal of the polyfills, indicates they are no longer needed and can be considered deprecated**
    ```
   # No code snippet available, this is a deprecation of polyfills for `CanvasRenderingContext2D` and no direct code is used to handle them
   ```

5. Deprecation: Legacy CSS styles.
 Example:
 Usecase: **This implies that specific old css styles are being deprecated and should not be used anymore .As it is related to css there is no code snipet that can be provided**
 ```
    # No code snippet available, as this refers to deprecated CSS
 ```

6. Deprecation:  `BOKEH_RESOURCES=server` usage related to domain resolution
Example:
Usecase: **This shows that  using `BOKEH_RESOURCES=server`  may have some issues with how domains are resolved. This is related to deployment, therefore not directly related to any bokeh code and thus, no code snippet is provided**
```
  # No code snippet available, as this relates to server configuration rather than python code
```

7. Deprecation:  `bokeh.core.json_encoder.serialize_json` example
Example:
Usecase: **The logs state that the example provided in the docs for `bokeh.core.json_encoder.serialize_json` is not correct and therefore should not be used. We cant not provide code as the issue is within the documentation and not within the functionality.**
```
    # No code snippet available, as this is related to documentation examples.
```

8.  Deprecation: Usage of `numpy.ndarray` with `ColumnDataSource.selected.indices`
    Example:
    Usecase: **The logs show that `ColumnDataSource.selected.indices` no longer works with `numpy.ndarray` and can be inferred that this usage is deprecated. The correct way to use this functionality would be to pass a `list` instead of `np.ndarray` as explained in the logs**
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource
    source = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6]))
    #Deprected
    source.selected.indices = np.array([0, 2])
    ```

9. Deprecation: Usage of `numpy.ndarray` with `IndexFilter`
Example:
Usecase:  **The logs state that `IndexFilter` no longer accepts `numpy.ndarray` and the usage of ndarray with `IndexFilter` is deprecated.**
```python
from bokeh.models import IndexFilter
import numpy as np
#Deprecated
filter = IndexFilter(indices=np.array([0, 2]))
```

**Summary**

The analysis reveals several deprecations, mostly related to internal API changes, refactoring, and the removal of outdated practices. Most of these are related to BokehJS , or internal structure and do not have a code snippet.  Some changes are related to underlying library usages such as Numpy or Selenium which are not under the control of the Bokeh library itself.
Okay, I've analyzed the provided logs for deprecation notices in the Bokeh visualization library. Here's a structured report of the deprecations I found, along with real-world use case examples:

1. Deprecation: `range1d(start, end)` syntax for creating a Range1d object has been removed.
   Example:
   Usecase : **Creating a Range1d object for setting the x-axis range of a plot**
   ```python
   from bokeh.models import Range1d
   from bokeh.plotting import figure, show

   # Deprecated syntax for creating Range1d
   # x_range = Range1d(0, 10) 

   # The correct way of doing it would be:
   x_range=Range1d(start=0, end=10)

   plot = figure(x_range=x_range)

   show(plot)
   ```

2. Deprecation: `columndatasource.column_names` attribute should now be accessed as a property method.
   Example:
   Usecase : **Getting the column names of a ColumnDataSource.**
   ```python
   from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource
   
   data = {'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 5, 6]}
   source = ColumnDataSource(data)

   # Deprecated way to access column names
   # column_names = source.column_names

   # The correct way of doing it is now:
   column_names = source.column_names

   print(column_names)
   ```

3. Deprecation: `Box_annotation` example used the deprecated `.ix` method for pandas dataframe indexing, should now use `.loc`.
    Example:
    Usecase : **Using .ix to access data in a box_annotation example**
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from bokeh.models import BoxAnnotation
    from bokeh.plotting import figure, show
    
    data = {'x': [1, 2, 3, 4], 'y': [6, 7, 2, 4]}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    
    # Deprecated ix method, now should be loc
    # annotation = BoxAnnotation(left=df.ix[1,'x'], right=df.ix[3, 'x'], fill_color='blue')
    
    # Correct way of doing it
    annotation = BoxAnnotation(left=df.loc[1,'x'], right=df.loc[3, 'x'], fill_color='blue')
    
    plot = figure(width=300, height=300)
    plot.add_layout(annotation)
    
    show(plot)
    ```
4. Deprecation: `.ix` method for pandas dataframe indexing should be replaced with `.loc`.
    Example:
    Usecase : **Using `.ix` to access data in a data frame in an example**
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from bokeh.plotting import figure, show

    data = {'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 5, 6]}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    
    # Deprecated ix method
    # x_values = df.ix[:, 'x']
    
    # Correct way to access data using loc
    x_values = df.loc[:, 'x']
    
    plot = figure()
    plot.circle(x=x_values, y=[1,2,3])
    show(plot)
    ```
5. Deprecation: `log.warn` usage should be replaced with `log.warning`.
    Example:
    Usecase : **Logging a warning message in Bokeh**
    ```python
    import logging

    log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    # Deprecated way of logging a warning message
    # log.warn("This is a warning message.")

    # Correct way to log a warning message
    log.warning("This is a warning message.")
    ```
   

These are the deprecations I could identify from the provided logs. Each entry includes a brief description, a use case, and an example with the deprecated code.
Okay, I've analyzed the provided logs for the Bokeh visualization library and identified the following deprecation:

1. Deprecation:  `np.int` is deprecated in numpy 1.20
   Example:
   Usecase:  Using `np.int` to define the data type of an array.
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    
    my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.int) 
    ```

2. Deprecation: `jinja2.Markup` is deprecated, use Jinja 3.1.
    Example:
    Usecase:  Using `jinja2.Markup` to escape HTML in templates.
    ```python
    from jinja2 import Markup

    safe_html = Markup("<div>some <b>html</b></div>")
    ```

3. Deprecation: Deprecate broken HSL objects
    Example:
    Usecase: Usage of `bokeh.colors.HSL` for color manipulations.
     ```python
     from bokeh.colors import HSL

     hsl_color = HSL(0, 1, 0.5)
     ```

4. Deprecation:  `nbserverproxy` is outdated
     Example:
     Usecase: Using the `nbserverproxy` to access bokeh server application through a proxy. 
    ```
    # This is not a code example, but a usage example, as it was a tool
    # In older documentation, nbserverproxy is referenced
    ```

5. Deprecation: Explicit Marker Models are removed
   Example:
   Usecase: Referencing specific marker models directly that are now consolidated.
   ```python
   # This example is conceptual, as it's about explicit models, not specific code.
   # Previously, you might have imported specific marker models like 
   # from bokeh.models import CircleMarker, SquareMarker, etc.
   # These explicit models are now handled through a unified approach.
   ```
   
I have provided a structured report of the deprecations I found in the Bokeh library logs. The `np.int` deprecation refers to a change in how NumPy handles integers, and the `jinja2.Markup` deprecation was caused by the library's upgrade. HSL objects and nbserverproxy are deprecated due to the new implementation. The removal of explicit marker models points to the simplification of how markers are used within Bokeh.
Okay, I've analyzed the provided logs for the Bokeh visualization library and identified the following deprecation:

1. Deprecation: `plot.h_symmetry` and `plot.v_symmetry` have been deprecated.
   Example:
   Usecase: **Setting the horizontal symmetry of a plot.**
```python
from bokeh.plotting import figure, show

# Deprecated: Using plot.h_symmetry and plot.v_symmetry
p = figure(width=400, height=400)
p.h_symmetry = True
p.v_symmetry = False
p.circle([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])

show(p)
```
Okay, I will analyze the provided logs and extract the deprecation information as requested.

Here is the structured report of the deprecations found:

1. Deprecation: `output_notebook` uses a deprecated API
   Example:
   Usecase :  A common way to display Bokeh plots in a Jupyter Notebook.

   ```python
   from bokeh.plotting import figure, show, output_notebook

   output_notebook()

   p = figure(width=400, height=400)
   p.circle([1,2,3], [4,5,6])
   show(p)
   ```

2. Deprecation: `models.util.structure` uses deprecated API
   Example:
   Usecase :  Using internal utilities to create models which might not be recommended or might have changed to a better way.

   ```python
    from bokeh.models.util import structure
   #Accessing internals for structuring, this specific example cannot be created without access to internals.
    # For demonstration purposes only as this exact use case is not user-facing
    
    structure.Model({})
   ```

3. Deprecation: `DeprecationWarning` for `color.darken()` method due to internal use of HSL methods.
   Example:
    Usecase : Darkening a color for visual adjustments in plots.

   ```python
    from bokeh.colors import RGB
    color = RGB(255, 0, 0) #red
    darker_color = color.darken(0.2)
    print(darker_color)
   ```

4. Deprecation: `FuncTickFormatter` is deprecated.
    Example:
    Usecase : Using a custom function to format tick labels on an axis.

   ```python
    from bokeh.models import FuncTickFormatter
    from bokeh.plotting import figure, show

    def custom_format(x):
        return f"{x:.2f} units"

    formatter = FuncTickFormatter(code="return " + custom_format)
    
    p = figure(x_range=(0, 10), y_range=(0,10))
    p.xaxis.formatter = formatter
    show(p)
   ```
    

5. Deprecation:  `CDSView.source` is deprecated and the source should be inferred from CDSView parent.
    Example:
    Usecase :  Accessing the source data from a CDSView instance which is now going to be inferred.
    ```python
    from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, CDSView
    source = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6]))
    view = CDSView(source=source, filters=[])
    
    #The deprecated usage of CDSView source.
    print(view.source)
    ```

6. Deprecation:  The `@deprecated` functionality of bokehjs.
     Example:
    Usecase : The use of  @deprecated function/class in bokehjs has been removed

    ```javascript
   // Hypothetical example from bokehjs internals as this is not a user facing API deprecation.
   
   class SomeClass {
    @deprecated
    someMethod(){}
    }

    ```

7. Deprecation:  `render_mode` has been dropped and HTML annotations split off.
   Example:
   Usecase : Using `render_mode` to control how annotations are rendered (no direct example as it has been removed)

    ```python
    # Example showing concept of usage that does not work in 3.0
    from bokeh.models import Label, Plot
    from bokeh.plotting import show
    
    label = Label(x=10, y=10, text="Some Text", render_mode='canvas')
    
    p = Plot(x_range=(0, 100), y_range=(0, 100), min_border=0)
    p.add_layout(label)
    show(p)
    ```
8. Deprecation: `bokeh.server.django` has been dropped.
    Example:
    Usecase : Utilizing the deprecated django integration that is no longer supported by Bokeh.

   ```python
   # Example that would not work in Bokeh 3.0
   from bokeh.server.django import autoload_server
   ```

Okay, I've analyzed the provided logs for the Bokeh visualization library and identified the following deprecation:

**Report of Deprecations**

1. Deprecation:  Deprecation warning treated as error in pytest hook
   Example:
   Usecase : Deprecation warnings were being treated as errors in pytest tests, which is not the intended behavior, this has been corrected.
   ```
    # This is not actual code, but rather it represents the context in which the deprecation was found.
   #  The deprecation was related to how pytest was handling warnings, not an actual code.
    # pytest was incorrectly treating deprecation warnings as errors in the test suite.
   ```

2. Deprecation: Remove old deprecations
   Example:
   Usecase: Old deprecated code was removed. There is no actual code to show because it was removed.
   ```
   # This indicates removal of old deprecated code; no example code is available, since all deprecated code were removed.
   ```
3. Deprecation: Deprecation warning in notebook_embed.ipynb
   Example:
   Usecase: A deprecation warning was present in the notebook_embed.ipynb example, indicating usage of deprecated code.
   ```
    # The exact deprecated code is not given in the log, only its presence. Therefore, an example cannot be provided.
   # This just notes where to find the deprecated code
   ```
I will continue to look through the logs to ensure I have found all the deprecations
