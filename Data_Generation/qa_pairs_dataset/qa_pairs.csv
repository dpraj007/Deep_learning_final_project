What significant changes were introduced in Version 3.0 of the Bokeh-Visualization library?,"['Latest Version: 3.6 (Released on 2024-09-26) Key Updates in Latest Version: Support for click events on categorical axes Addition of CustomJSTicker Addition of ""open image in a new tab"" mode to save tool a)  Key Updates in Latest Version: Support for click events on categorical axes Addition of CustomJSTicker Addition of ""open image in a new tab"" mode to save tool a) Summary of Changes Bokeh-Visualization library has undergone significant evolution from its early versions to the latest 3.6 release. Key changes include major redesigns of the layout system in versions prior to 1.1.0, enhancing responsiveness and usability. Version 2.2 introduced SVG export for grid plots and a DocumentReady event. Version 2.4 brought consolidated RangeUpdate events and LaTeX support for axis labels. Version 3.0 marked a major milestone with the removal of Python 3.7 support, introduction of math text glyphs, and click event support on categorical axes. Version 3.1 added persistent selection overlays and background/border support for text glyphs. Version 3.2 focused on WebGL support for several glyphs and ES module callback support. Version 3.3 introduced the ColorMap widget and enhanced AutocompleteInput usability. Version 3.4 added significant features like math text glyphs and click events on categorical axes. Version 3.5 introduced a new Carbon theme and further enhanced math text and click event support, while also dropping support for Python 3.9. Finally, version 3.6 continued to build on these features, adding a CustomJSTicker and an ""open image in a new tab"" mode for the save tool. Throughout these versions, there has been a consistent focus on improving performance, usability, and extending Bokeh\'s capabilities in handling various types of data and visualizations. b) Key Updates Layout System: Major improvements to responsiveness and usability were introduced, making it easier to create complex layouts. WebGL Support: Expanded WebGL support for glyphs like Annulus, Wedge, and AnnularWedge enhances performance for large datasets. ES Module Callbacks: Version 3.2 added support for ES module syntax in callbacks, improving code maintainability and integration with modern JavaScript practices. ColorMap Widget: Version 3.3 introduced a new ColorMap widget, simplifying the selection of color palettes. Accessibility: Version 3.3 made AutocompleteInput more usable by allowing matching on any part of input items. Math Text Glyphs: Version 3.0 introduced support for math text glyphs, enabling LaTeX rendering in various parts of the plot. Click Events on Categorical Axes: Version 3.0 added support for click events on categorical axes, enhancing interactivity. Carbon Theme: Version 3.5 added a new Carbon theme, providing a modern look and feel. CustomJSTicker: Version 3.6 introduced CustomJSTicker, allowing for greater customization of axis tick formatting. Save Tool Enhancement: Version 3.6 added an ""open image in a new tab"" mode to the save tool.
