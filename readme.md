# Techniques for Niche Libraries

This project explores techniques to improve Large Language Models (LLMs) for niche libraries, focusing on finetuning and unlearning methods to enhance adaptability and reliability.

## Project Overview

The project addresses challenges in adapting LLMs to dynamic datasets, particularly in domains with frequent updates or deprecations. It uses Codellama models and focuses on the Bokeh library as a case study.

## Key Features

- Synthetic dataset creation from library changelogs
- Finetuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
- Unlearning framework for removing outdated information
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
